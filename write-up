How you would take this proof-of-concept command line application and convert it to a fully featured web application?

Here are a few considerations

Front-end
Since this app is more about the data returned it will be absolutely necessary to develop a very informative and user-friendly UI that helps the users with engagement and locating 
the information in an interactive way.

Load balancers 
FOr increased loads of users requesting the data , load balancing will help with redirecting requests to mulitple servers calling the socrata API.

Caching
Since the app is read heavy and there are a lot of chances of overlapping results at the same time the caching mechanism will help offload the network calls and make the response times faster.

Logging 
Would like to ensure concrete logging mechanism across the steps to trace the errors as well as application problems as it scales over time to serve more and more users.

Zip-code/radius based searches
Would try to explore options for providing the users with a distance based search helping improve the result quality and user experience. 

Future modifications
Can create new inhouse stored endpoint to save reviews for each foodtruck. Make it a more engaging and informative community driven application with introducing options to post reviews/pictures etc.
